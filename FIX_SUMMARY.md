# Instagram Location Extraction Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Instagram data fetching script was incorrectly parsing Chinese text from post captions instead of recognizing English country names. Specifically:

- Peru posts were showing location as "這的理由" (Chinese text) instead of "Peru"
- Missing South American countries in the location detection system

## Root Cause
1. **Chinese Location Pattern**: A regex pattern `/在([^#@\n\r。，]+?)(?=[。，\s]*[#@\n\r]|$)/i` was matching Chinese text within captions
2. **Missing Countries**: South American countries were not included in the country list
3. **Missing Coordinates**: No coordinate mappings for South American countries

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Location Pattern Cleanup (`scripts/location-patterns.js`)
- ✅ **REMOVED** the problematic Chinese location regex that was incorrectly matching text
- ✅ **ADDED** all South American countries to countryList:
  - Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana

### 2. Enhanced Coordinate Support (`scripts/fetch-instagram-data.js`)
- ✅ **ADDED** South American country coordinates to `getCountryCoordinates()`
- ✅ **ADDED** major South American cities to location mapping:
  - Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu (Peru)
  - La Paz, Uyuni (Bolivia)
  - Santiago (Chile)
  - Buenos Aires (Argentina)
  - Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo (Brazil)
  - Bogotá (Colombia)
  - Caracas (Venezuela)
  - Quito (Ecuador)
  - Montevideo (Uruguay)
  - Asunción (Paraguay)

### 3. Pattern Priority Optimization
The location patterns now prioritize in this order:
1. Explicit location markers (📍, Location:)
2. Country・City format
3. City, Country format
4. **Direct country names** (this now correctly catches "Peru" first)
5. Specific city/location patterns

## Test Results
✅ **Peru Caption Test**: 
- Input: `"Peru \n秘魯 .\n.\n是因為有出發的理由\n還是沒有留在這的理由\n而選擇出走？"`
- OLD Result: Matched Chinese text "這的理由" as city
- NEW Result: Correctly matches "Peru" as country

✅ **Chinese Text Test**:
- Chinese-only text no longer matches any location patterns
- Prevents false positives from caption body text

## Current Status
### Completed ✅
- [x] Fixed location pattern regex issues
- [x] Added South American country support  
- [x] Enhanced coordinate mappings
- [x] Updated GitHub Actions workflows with proper permissions
- [x] Added error handling and fallbacks

### Next Steps 🔄
1. **Commit and Deploy**: Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Data Refresh**: Wait for automatic Instagram data fetch to run with new logic
3. **Verification**: Check that Peru posts now show correct location data
4. **Missing Post Investigation**: Determine why `BxjT2XwlRxl` post is not in dataset

## Files Modified
- `scripts/location-patterns.js` - Location pattern definitions
- `scripts/fetch-instagram-data.js` - Instagram data processing logic
- `.github/workflows/auto-fetch-instagram.yml` - Automated workflow
- `.github/workflows/update-travel-data.yml` - Data update workflow

## Expected Outcome
After the next Instagram data fetch runs:
- Peru posts will show `"country": "Peru"` instead of incorrect Chinese text
- All South American countries will be properly detected and mapped
- Location extraction will be more accurate and reliable
